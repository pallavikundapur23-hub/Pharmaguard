          "llm_explanation": "The 'DPYD' gene diplotype *1/*2 indicates you have one normal copy and one slightly different copy of the gene. However, this combination still allows for normal function. Your phenotype, Normal Metabolizer, means your body processes certain medications, like some cancer drugs, as expected. The Activity Score of 1.00 confirms this, indicating normal enzyme activity. As a Normal Metabolizer, your body breaks down these medications at a standard rate, neither too fast nor too slow. This means you're likely to respond to these medications as predicted, without increased risk of side effects or reduced efficacy due to unusually fast or slow processing.",

      "dosing": "As an intermediate metabolizer of CYP2D6, the patient's body may not effectively activate clopidogrel, a prodrug. This affects dose metabolism, potentially leading to reduced antiplatelet activity and increased risk of thrombotic events.\n\nA dose adjustment may be necessary to ensure efficacy. Consider increasing the dose to 225-300 mg loading dose, followed by 75-150 mg daily.\n\nMonitor the patient's platelet function and adjust the dose accordingly. Also, watch for signs of bleeding, such as bruising, petechiae, or gastrointestinal bleeding.\n\nKey warning signs to watch for include:\n- Unusual bleeding or bruising\n- Chest pain or shortness of breath\n- Headache or dizziness\n- Abdominal pain or vomiting\n\nPrioritize patient safety by closely monitoring their response to clopidogrel and adjusting the dose as needed to minimize the risk of adverse events. Consult with a healthcare provider or pharmacist for personalized guidance.",

Commonly affected drugs include antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine), antipsychotics (e.g., risperidone), and pain medications (e.g., codeine).\n3. Metabolism pattern: slower than normal.\n4. Clinical significance: Intermediate Metabolizers may experience higher drug concentrations, increasing the risk of side effects. Dose adjustments may be necessary to avoid toxicity and ensure efficacy. Close monitoring is recommended when prescribing affected medications."

      "variant_interpretation": "The 'CYP2D6' gene helps your body process certain medications. Your genetic profile shows a diplotype of *1/*2, meaning you have one normal and one slightly less active copy of the gene. This results in an Intermediate Metabolizer phenotype and an Activity Score of 1.00. The activity score indicates your body's ability to process drugs is moderately reduced. As an Intermediate Metabolizer, your body processes certain medications at a slower rate than normal, but faster than those with poor metabolism. This may affect how you respond to certain medications, and your doctor may need to adjust doses to ensure safe and effective treatment.",
      "risk_explanation": "The interaction between Clopidogrel and the CYP2D6 gene affects how the body processes the drug. As an Intermediate Metabolizer, the body breaks down Clopidogrel less efficiently, leading to reduced antiplatelet effect. This means the drug may not work as well to prevent blood clots.\n\nThe Intermediate Metabolizer phenotype slows down Clopidogrel metabolism, resulting in lower levels of the active form of the drug. This increases the risk of inadequate treatment.\n\nThis interaction is classified as 'Adjust Dosage' because the reduced metabolism may require a higher dose of Clopidogrel to achieve therapeutic levels. Key patient safety points include monitoring for signs of inadequate antiplatelet effect and considering alternative treatments or dose adjustments to ensure effective treatment and minimize the risk of blood clots. Close medical supervision is necessary to optimize therapy.",
